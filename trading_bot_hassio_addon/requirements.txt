# Market data for Directa fallback: direct Yahoo Finance HTTP calls.
# yfinance is NOT used — it pulls in lxml, frozendict, peewee (C extensions)
# that have no prebuilt musl/ARM wheels and require gcc/libcurl-dev headers,
# causing compilation failures on armv7/armhf/aarch64 Alpine containers.
# trading/data.py calls the Yahoo Finance v8 chart API directly via requests.
